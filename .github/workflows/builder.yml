# +--------------------+
# WORKFLOW SUMMARY
# +--------------------+

## 1. Builds Docker Images and uploads them to remote Docker Registry
## 2. Does signature validation to ensure Docker Images (in the Registry) have not been tampered with.

on:
#  schedule:
    ## When our Docker Images are rebuilt, package updates occur
    ## By executing this workflow on a recurring schedule, we minimize
    ## vulnerabilities that can be discovered by Trivy
    ## COMMENTED OUT TO SAVE RESOURCES
#    - cron: '0 0 * * *'
  push:
    branches:
      ## When a Pull Request is accepted, its code is merged into the main branch
      ## At that point, this workflow will be triggered and Docker Images will be uploaded 
      ## to the Registry
      - main
    paths-ignore:
      ## When a Docker Image is built, the Image's unique signature 
      ## is committed into the main branch of the Git repo.
      ## (This allows us to check for malicious updates to Docker Images)
      
      ## This workflow file will invoke docker-registry-orchestrator.sh
      
      ## docker-registry-orchestrator.sh:
      ## a) commits a Docker Image's signature into the main branch
      ##                  (see path below)
      ## b) uses the signature to check for Docker Registry tampering
      
      ## If we allowed this path to trigger this workflow, we would
      ## have an infinite loop
